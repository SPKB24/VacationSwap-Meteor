          <p><br>Vacations are fun and meant to be relaxing, why should the
            process of planning one be any different? We created this website
            to solve an issue that we have faced in our own lives and to
            complete a requirement for GUI Prototyping II with Professor
            Wenjin Zhou.</p>
